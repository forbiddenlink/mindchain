## ðŸš€ Latest Updates - Topic Selection & Stop Button Fixes

### Bug Fixes
- **FIXED: Topic Selection System** 
  - Recreated missing `generateMessage.js` file with proper topic parameter handling
  - AI agents now correctly discuss the selected topic instead of always defaulting to climate change
  - All 8+ predefined topics now work properly: Climate Policy, AI Regulation, Healthcare, Immigration, Education, Taxation, Social Media, Space Exploration
  - Custom topic functionality also working correctly

- **FIXED: Stop Button Functionality**
  - Added `stopDebate` method to frontend API service
  - Updated `handleStopDebate` in Controls.jsx to properly call backend API
  - Added loading states and error handling for stop button
  - Added `debate_stopped` WebSocket event handling in App.jsx
  - Stop button now properly terminates running debates instead of just updating UI

### Technical Details
- `generateMessage.js`: Now accepts `topic` parameter and uses it in AI prompts
- Server properly passes selected topic from frontend to AI generation
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback for debate controls
- Proper cleanup of active debate state when stopped

### Testing
