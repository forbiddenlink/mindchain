# Topic-Aware Semantic Caching Fix

## Problem
- Agents were talking about healthcare even when climate topics were selected
- Cache hit rate of 95.8% meant almost all responses came from cache
- Cache was finding similar prompts regardless of topic context

## Solution
1. **Enhanced Cache Key Generation**: Include topic in cache key creation
2. **Topic-Aware Embeddings**: Include topic context in embedding generation  
3. **Topic-Specific Matching**: Cache searches now consider topic context
4. **Cache Reset**: Cleared old cache entries that lacked topic awareness

## Technical Changes
- `semanticCache.js`: Added topic parameter to all cache functions
- `generateMessage.js`: Pass topic to cache functions
- Cache data now stores `topic` and `original_prompt` separately
- Embeddings now include "Topic: {topic}. {prompt}" for better context

## Result
- Cache will now properly differentiate between climate and healthcare prompts
- Agents will generate topic-appropriate responses
- Cache efficiency maintained while ensuring topic accuracy

## Files Modified
- `semanticCache.js` - Topic-aware caching logic
- `generateMessage.js` - Pass topic to cache functions  
- `clearCache.js` - Reset cache for fresh start

## Next Steps
- Test with different topics (climate, healthcare, education)
- Monitor cache hit rates for topic-specific accuracy
- Verify agents discuss selected topics correctly
