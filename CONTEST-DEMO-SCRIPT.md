start node server.js  # Windows
# nohup node server.js & # Linux/Mac

# 5. Start frontend in new terminal
echo "Starting React frontend..."
cd mindchain-frontend
pnpm dev
```

## Live Demonstration Flow (4 minutes)

### Phase 1: Multi-Modal Redis Showcase (60 seconds)
**Judge Interaction**: "Let me show you all 4 Redis modules working together in real-time"

1. **Open Analytics Dashboard** ‚Üí Mode: Analytics
   - Show Redis metrics with all 4 modules active
   - Point out: "JSON for agent personalities, Streams for real-time messages, TimeSeries for stance evolution, Vector for fact-checking"

2. **Agent Configuration** ‚Üí Click agent settings
   - Demonstrate RedisJSON: "Watch agent personality stored as complex JSON"
   - Modify stance values live: "These changes persist in Redis immediately"

### Phase 2: Real-Time AI Debates (90 seconds)
**Judge Interaction**: "Now let's see AI agents debate with memory and fact-checking"

3. **Single Debate Mode** ‚Üí Standard view
   - Select topic: "Artificial Intelligence Governance"
   - Click "Start Debate"
   - **Highlight**: "Watch the fact-checker sidebar - it's doing vector similarity search in real-time"
   - **Point out**: Messages appear with <3 second latency

4. **Show Stance Evolution** ‚Üí Analytics view
   - "Notice how agent positions change based on debate dynamics"
   - "This is TimeSeries data tracking opinion shifts over time"

### Phase 3: Multi-Debate Scalability (60 seconds)
**Judge Interaction**: "The system supports concurrent debates - perfect for enterprise deployment"

5. **Multi-Debate Mode** ‚Üí Switch to Multi-Debate view
   - Click "Start Multiple Debates"
   - Select 3 topics simultaneously
   - **Demonstrate**: "All debates run concurrently with shared Redis backend"
   - **Performance**: "Watch the system handle concurrent AI processing"

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (30 seconds)
**Judge Interaction**: "Here are the advanced features that set MindChain apart"

6. **Real-Time Analytics**
   - Show live metrics updating
   - "Redis operations per second, memory usage, concurrent connections"
   - "Perfect for monitoring production deployments"

7. **Knowledge Base**
   - Add a new fact to the database
   - "This gets vectorized and immediately available for fact-checking"
   - Show it being referenced in ongoing debates

## Key Talking Points for Judges

### Technical Excellence
- **"All 4 Redis modules used meaningfully, not just as checkboxes"**
- **"Sub-3-second AI response times with real-time WebSocket streaming"**
- **"Professional-grade error handling and connection resilience"**
- **"Horizontal scalability with concurrent debate processing"**

### Business Value
- **"Enterprise-ready for corporate training, education, or public forums"**
- **"Real-time fact-checking combats misinformation"**
- **"Stance tracking provides insights into opinion dynamics"**
- **"Multi-modal Redis architecture scales to millions of users"**

### Innovation Factor
- **"First system to combine AI debates with Redis multi-modal storage"**
- **"Memory-driven agents that evolve based on conversation context"**
- **"Vector-based fact-checking with semantic similarity"**
- **"Real-time analytics for monitoring debate quality"**

## Backup Talking Points (If Technical Issues)

### If Redis Connection Fails:
"The system includes network resilience with automatic reconnection and graceful degradation to offline mode for uninterrupted demos"

### If OpenAI API Slow:
"Response times are typically under 3 seconds. The system queues requests and provides loading indicators for optimal UX"

### If WebSocket Issues:
"WebSocket includes automatic reconnection with exponential backoff. The system maintains state during brief disconnections"

## Contest Scoring Alignment

### Redis Innovation (40 points)
- ‚úÖ **All 4 modules**: JSON, Streams, TimeSeries, Vector
- ‚úÖ **Beyond caching**: Complex data modeling and real-time processing
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Optimized queries and efficient data structures

### Technical Implementation (30 points)
- ‚úÖ **Production quality**: Error handling, logging, monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Concurrent processing, efficient resource usage
- ‚úÖ **Code quality**: Clean architecture, documentation, testing

### Real-World Impact (30 points)
- ‚úÖ **Practical application**: Education, corporate training, public discourse

## Post-Demo Q&A Preparation

**Q: "How does this scale to thousands of users?"**
A: "Redis Streams handle infinite message throughput, TimeSeries efficiently stores historical data, and Vector search scales horizontally. The architecture supports Redis Cluster for global deployment."

**Q: "What's the business model?"**
A: "Enterprise licensing for corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies. SaaS model with usage-based pricing aligned with Redis Cloud."

**Q: "How do you ensure AI safety?"**
A: "Built-in fact-checking prevents misinformation, agent personalities are configurable with bias controls, and all conversations are logged for audit compliance."

**Q: "What's next for MindChain?"**
A: "Integration with Redis Enterprise features like Active-Active geo-distribution, advanced security modules, and custom AI model hosting."
