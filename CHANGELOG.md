*Development History and Recent Updates*

## 🔧 **Latest Updates - August 1, 2025**

### **Agent Alternation & Semantic Cache Optimization - Debate Engine Reliability**
*Critical improvements to debate flow, agent behavior, and caching system*

**FIXED: Agent Double-Response Issue**
- ✅ Resolved SenatorBot speaking twice before ReformerBot responds
- ✅ Implemented `lastSpeakerPerDebate` tracking to enforce proper agent alternation
- ✅ Added agent-specific semantic caching to prevent cross-agent response sharing
- ✅ Increased message cooldown from 1 second to 2 seconds per agent for better pacing

**ENHANCED: Semantic Cache Precision**
- ✅ Raised similarity threshold from 85% to 95% to reduce aggressive caching
- ✅ Implemented agent-specific cache keys (`${agentId}:${topic}:${profileName}`)
- ✅ Ensures each agent maintains unique cached responses and personality
- ✅ Prevents agents from sharing cached responses that could break character

**IMPROVED: Debate Flow Control**
- ✅ Added last speaker verification before message generation
- ✅ Enhanced turn-based alternation system with proper enforcement
- ✅ Improved timing controls to prevent rapid-fire duplicate messages

**TECHNICAL ENHANCEMENTS:**
```javascript
// Agent alternation enforcement
const lastSpeaker = lastSpeakerPerDebate.get(debateId);
if (lastSpeaker === agentId) {
    console.log(`⚠️ ${agentId} spoke last, enforcing alternation by skipping...`);
    continue;
}

// Agent-specific caching
const agentSpecificTopic = `${agentId}:${topic}:${profile.name}`;
const cachedResult = await getCachedResponse(prompt, agentSpecificTopic);
```
