## 🔧 **Recent Updates - August 1, 2025**

### **Major Backend Enhancement - Eliminated Duplicate Messages**
*Enterprise-grade reliability improvements*

**FIXED: Duplicate Message Issue**
- ✅ Resolved SenatorBot messages repeating before ReformerBot responses
- ✅ Root cause: Both `generateEnhancedMessage()` and `generateMessage()` were storing to Redis streams
- ✅ Server fallback from enhanced to standard AI was causing double storage

**IMPLEMENTED: Centralized Stream Storage**
- ✅ Created `generateMessageOnly()` and `generateEnhancedMessageOnly()` functions
- ✅ These functions generate AI responses without storing to Redis streams
- ✅ Server now handles all Redis stream storage centrally in one location
- ✅ Eliminates race conditions and ensures exactly-once message delivery

**NEW FUNCTIONS:**
```javascript
// AI generation without storage
generateMessageOnly(agentId, debateId, topic)
generateEnhancedMessageOnly(agentId, debateId, topic)

// Centralized Redis stream storage in runDebateRounds()
```

**Contest Quality Improvements:**
- **RELIABILITY**: Eliminates message duplication during live demos
- **PERFORMANCE**: More efficient Redis operations with single storage point
- **MONITORING**: Clearer debugging output and error tracking
- **SCALABILITY**: Better architecture for concurrent debate processing
